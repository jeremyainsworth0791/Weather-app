# Weather-app

This app was created to provide a quick and simple way to see the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast for any city.
The weather is pulled from https://openweathermap.org/ and parsed into multiple functions to display the current temperature, wind speed, humidity and UV index for the user.
The date is provided by moment.js and the users previous searches are storeed locally to allow the user easier access to the information they require
